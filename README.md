I have the Combiner working exactly how I want it to work but I havent pushed it to git hub yet (I was tired and forgot). Also I need to update the 'requirements.txt" as im using some new/different libraries. - 5/3/2022

Aight... so... I spent like 4 hours writing like 5 lines of code, but.... I made HUGE progress with understing the QuickBooks API. I have 0 clue what i was doing befor but i found a page with like a gold mine of info(https://github.com/troolee/quickbooks-python). Check out my last commit notes or whatever its called where i explain pulling customer invoice info using just the Invoice number AKA "DocNumber". - 5/12/2022


Another fresh commit. Hopefully ill have this thing fully funtioning minus a few bugs by the end of the week. Well.... fully functioning other than the Oath2 flow. I still have to manually enter an authorization code and refresh token.  - 5/17-2022


I needed to take some time off cause i was completley stuck. I finally figured out a solution to the problem i was having. Now i just need to integrate the OAuth2, work on error handeling, get the console working, work on a few other fetures, and lastly fix acouple bugs im aware of. - 7/9/2022


I pretty much finished everything in my last update to this readme EXCEPT for the Oauth2 implementation. Thats the last piece of the puzzle before V.1 is working the way i want it and ill be able to actually use this in production.  - 7/17/2022
