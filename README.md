Aight... so... I spent like 4 hours writing like 5 lines of code, but.... I made HUGE progress with understing the QuickBooks API. I have 0 clue what i was doing befor but i found a page with like a gold mine of info(https://github.com/troolee/quickbooks-python). Check out my last commit notes or whatever its called where i explain pulling customer invoice info using just the Invoice number AKA "DocNumber". - 5/12/2022
